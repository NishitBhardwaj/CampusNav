/// CampusNav - Navigation Engine Placeholder
///
/// Placeholder for the A* pathfinding navigation engine.
/// Will be fully implemented in Phase 1.
///
/// Features (planned):
/// - A* algorithm for optimal path finding
/// - Multi-floor navigation support
/// - Real-time position tracking
/// - Turn-by-turn instructions
/// - Rerouting on deviation

// This file serves as a placeholder to maintain project structure.
// See lib/domain/navigation/ for the existing implementation.
//
// TODO Phase 1:
// - Integrate with sensor service for position updates
// - Add turn-by-turn instruction generation
// - Implement rerouting logic
// - Add accessibility route options
